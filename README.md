# World Bank Indicator Analysis

# Overview

In this assignment, you are tasked with working as a data analyst for the World Bank using the World Development Indicator (WDI) database. The WDI contains vast amounts of data related to global development, covering areas such as economics, health, education, and poverty levels. You'll work with large datasets from the WDI, which include various development indicators such as GDP, inflation, and social metrics like education levels and healthcare access. You’ll write SQL queries to extract and analyze specific data from the WDI, using those results to draw insights and create reports. You’ll use these queries to generate a final HTML report showcasing your findings.

## Prerequisites

* Before starting, make sure the following tools are installed and ready:
* VS Code: For managing and editing project files
* Git: For cloning and committing changes to your repository
* Quarto: For rendering .qmd reports into HTML
* Poetry: For managing Python dependencies and environments

## Requirements
* Build a relational database using the provided schema for the World Development Indicator (WDI) database.
* Complete the DDL file to define the structure of the tables for storing economic, social, and health data from the WDI database.
* Use Quarto to create a report with embedded SQL queries to analyze the WDI data and present your findings.
* Extract meaningful insights by associating specific indicators with the countries or regions they apply to, along with any relevant time-based data.
* Display the results of your queries in the final HTML report, ensuring that your findings are clear and well-structured.


**Example Workflow**

1. Clone the project repository to your machine from GitHub.
2. Use Poetry to install the necessary dependencies and activate your Python environment.
3. Render the starter report.qmd file to HTML, which will serve as the foundation for your report.
5. Create a connection to your local database using SQL.
6. Run the DDL.sql file to build the schema, ensuring the correct structure for storing WDI data.
7. Add sample data from the WDI and complete the Quarto Markdown (QMD) file with the appropriate SQL queries.
9. Push all changes to your GitHub repository to keep track of your work.
10. Submit your GitHub repository for autograding on Gradescope and your final HTML report on Canvas.
